# Oxford Temperature Prediction

A C++ program built on a hard-coded implementation of the linear regression algorithm to forecast daily temperatures in Oxford, UK.

## How to run
1. Change linear regression model in main cpp if required.
2. Build, compile to generate /debug folder and executable.
3. Move Met Office data into /debug folder.
4. Run executable file.

## Data
* Open source data taken from the [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/pub/data/weather/uk/climate/stationdata/oxforddata.txt
)
* If provided other data, the format should also be in the same style as the Met Office.

## Analysis
