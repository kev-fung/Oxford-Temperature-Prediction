# Oxford Temperature Prediction

A C++ program built on a hard-coded implementation of the linear regression algorithm to forecast daily temperatures in Oxford, UK.

## How to run
Move into the debug folder and run the executable file, the data should be in the same folder as the executable. Data format should also be in the same style as provided by the Met Office.

## Data
Open source data taken from the Met Office:
https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/pub/data/weather/uk/climate/stationdata/oxforddata.txt

## Implementations
A basic gui based on command line has been provided.

Several cleaning methodologies were hard implemented into the code: the code only works for Met Office data.

See code description for further information on software design.
